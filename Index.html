        and extroversion. But we have to know how to control these tempraments so they dont hurt us.

          <h2 style="color: blue;">Introversion</h2>
          When we talk about introversion, we dont necessarily mean when someone is always quiet or always to
          his or herself.... we actually mean more than that. It really goes on to be deeper than 
          that. Some people dont just become introverts... For most people, Its the circumstances around them.
